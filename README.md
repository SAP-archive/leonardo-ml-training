# Description
SAP Leonardo cloud platform offerings provides pretrained Machine Learning functional core services, which can be accommodated or extended as per your requirements. In this use case, you retrain an existing functional service with your own custom data set. Then you can consume it directly. [Github - "Customer Risk Intelligence"](https://github.wdf.sap.corp/staging-for-SAP-samples-public/s4hana-ext-customer-risk-intelligence) makes use of this service in its custom usecase.

## SAP Extensibility Explorer
This tutorial is one of multiple tutorials that make up the SAP Extensibility Explorer for SAP S/4HANA Cloud. SAP Extensibility Explorer is a central place where anyone involved in the extensibility process can gain insight into various types of extensibility options. At the heart of [SAP Extensibility Explorer](https://sap.com/extends4), there is a rich repository of sample scenarios which show, in a hands-on way, how to realize an extensibility requirement leveraging different extensibility patterns.
